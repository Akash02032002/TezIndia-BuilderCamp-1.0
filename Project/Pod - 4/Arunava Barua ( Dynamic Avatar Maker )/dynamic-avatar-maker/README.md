Avatar Maker WebApp Powered by Tezos
Build By Arunava Barua and Rashiya Dhruv in TezIndia Buildercamp 1.0
Welcome to the Avatar Maker WebApp! This web application allows users to create and customize their own avatars using Tezos as the underlying blockchain technology. The application is built using SmartPy for smart contract development and Taquito JS for integration with the Tezos blockchain.


How it Works
The Avatar Maker WebApp utilizes smart contracts written in SmartPy to handle the creation and customization of avatars on the Tezos blockchain. Users can interact with the smart contracts through the web interface, which is built using ReactJS and TaquitoJS.

When a user creates a new avatar, a new NFT is minted to the Tezos blockchain. The user's customized avatar data is stored on the blockchain within this smart contract, ensuring that it cannot be altered or deleted.

We had fun making this tool and we hope you like it too.
