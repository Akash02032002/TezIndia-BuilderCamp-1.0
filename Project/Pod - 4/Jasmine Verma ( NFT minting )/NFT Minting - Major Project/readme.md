# NFT Minting Project Readme

This project is a simple NFT minting platform where users can upload their images and mint them as NFTs. The platform is built using SmartPy for the smart contracts and React.js for the user interface. Here are the links to the contract and UI:

- User interface: [https://bejewelled-youtiao-7674cf.netlify.app/](https://bejewelled-youtiao-7674cf.netlify.app/)

## How it works

The platform allows users to upload their images and mint them as NFTs. Here's a brief overview of how the platform works:

1. The user uploads an image.
2. The image is stored on IPFS.
3. The user enters the required information (name, description, etc.).
4. The user mints the NFT.
5. The NFT is created and stored on the Tezos blockchain.

## Features

The platform has the following features:

- Upload images: Users can upload their images to mint as NFTs.
- Unique NFTs: Each NFT is unique and can only be minted once.
- IPFS integration: Images are stored on IPFS for efficient and decentralized storage.
- Meta-data: Users can enter meta-data for their NFTs, such as name, description, and tags.

## Technologies Used

The platform is built using the following technologies:

- SmartPy: The smart contracts are written in SmartPy.
- React.js: The user interface is built using React.js.
- IPFS: Images are stored on IPFS for efficient and decentralized storage of images.
- Better Call Dev: This platform is used to deploy and interact with the smart contract.

## Getting Started

To run the platform locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.

## Conclusion

This is a simple NFT minting platform that allows users to upload their images and mint them as NFTs. The platform uses SmartPy for the smart contracts and React.js for the user interface. It also integrates with IPFS for efficient and decentralized storage of images, and is deployed on the Tezos blockchain.
