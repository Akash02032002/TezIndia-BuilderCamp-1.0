# Patent-India with Tezoz 
A patent is a legal protection granted to inventors for their unique inventions or discoveries. 
It gives the inventor the exclusive right to prevent others from making, using, selling, or importing the invention for a set period of time.

# Solution 

While storing an idea on the blockchain can provide evidence of the idea's existence and the individual's ownership, it may not necessarily protect against someone else filing a patent for the same idea. The patent system generally operates on a "first to file" basis, meaning that the first person to file a patent application for an idea will generally be granted the patent rights, regardless of who came up with the idea first.

<br/>
However, having a record of the idea's existence and ownership could be useful in the event of a patent dispute, as it could help establish that the individual had prior claim to the idea. 
<br/>
Additionally, keeping detailed records and documentation of the idea's development process can also be helpful in proving ownership and defending against patent infringement claims.
<br/> 
Ultimately, while storing an idea on the blockchain may provide some level of protection, it is not a foolproof solution, and seeking legal advice from a patent attorney or agent is always recommended for those looking to protect their intellectual property.
